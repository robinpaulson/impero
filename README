Impero is an experimental fork of the Zotero extension for Firefox. It is in no way connected to the organisation behind Zotero, other than using the code they have released under the AGPL. It is not blessed by the original authors, and no support is available from them.

The intention of Impero is to make modifications to Zotero, to allow a user to synchronise their data with a server hosted at a location other than on zotero.org.

The extension provided here should be considered unstable, and not for use in a production environment.

There is a risk of data loss if you do not know what you are doing.

In order to use the functions provided, you will also need to install and set up a zotero data server. See https://github.com/robinpaulson/dataserver for the source.

The extension is available pre-built from:

Alternatively, run the build-script file to build it yourself. You will need to add in the 'translators' and 'styles' submodules first.
